# The-road-runner
This was the final project for my Data Structures and algorithms class. The project was implemented in Java. UI was done in JavaFX. I did it as part of a team of 2.
## Goal
Write a program to simulate a simpler version of the Coyote and the Road Runnerâ€™s world. Build an environment for the Road Runner to run wild making sure that she gets to her destination as fast as possible while avoiding the Coyote and his complex contraptions.
We were free to mmake programming designs as we wished keeping in mind that the goal was to write clean, correct and efficient algorithms with smart tradeoffs between time and space.

##Concepts Covered
1. Graphs
2. Graph search algorithms--Implemented Djikstra, Depth First Search and A-star
3. Building UI using Java Frameworks
4. Algorithm design and analysis
5. Implementation and selecting efficient data structures
6. Basic game development
